# STELLA

**System for Testing and Engineering LLM-based Conversational Agents**

STELLA is a NestJS-based control plane for managing conversational AI sessions with LiveKit WebRTC integration and Kubernetes agent orchestration.

## What is STELLA?

STELLA provides a complete infrastructure for building, deploying, and managing voice-enabled AI agents. It handles:

- **Real-time Communication**: WebRTC-based voice and data streaming via LiveKit
- **Agent Orchestration**: Automatic Kubernetes pod management for AI agents
- **Session Management**: Track conversations, participants, and messages
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for multiple agent types with customizable pipelines
